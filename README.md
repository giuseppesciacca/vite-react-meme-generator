# React + Vite + Bootstrap + Scss

## Meme-Generator

Second small application I built while studying react.

With the click of the button there is a change of the meme-image and it is possible to write text on it.

It's an exercise to familiarise myself with the React library:

- Responding to Events;
- useState with Objects;
- Rendering different JSX depending on a condition (Conditional Rendering);
- useEffect for synchronize a component with an external system (API);
